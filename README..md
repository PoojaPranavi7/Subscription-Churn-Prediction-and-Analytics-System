# Subscription Churn Prediction & Analytics System

## Overview
End-to-end subscription churn prediction pipeline using Python + SQL, with production-style validation, experiment tracking, feature importance, and lightweight monitoring. Final insights are delivered via Tableau dashboards using scored customer risk outputs.

## Key Features
- SQL-backed ingestion & feature table creation
- Automated preprocessing (missing values, encoding, scaling, log features)
- Model training + evaluation (Accuracy/F1/ROC-AUC)
- Feature importance to explain churn drivers
- Monitoring to detect data/pipeline drift across runs
- Tableau-ready outputs (risk scoring + churn insights dashboards)

## Tech Stack
Python, SQL (Postgres/SQLite), scikit-learn, Tableau

## Repo Structure
- `src/` pipeline scripts
- `sql/` table + feature queries
- `notebooks/` EDA
- `outputs/` models, metrics, predictions
- `tableau/` extracts and dashboard screenshots
- `portfolio_screenshots/` proof of work per phase

## How to Run (will be filled phase-by-phase)
Coming soon.
